    <h2>I've learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.</h2>
    <h3>My purpose: to lift your spirit and to motivate you.</h3>
    <p>Life is full of both joys and disasters. The ups and downs of life are what they're called. Without them, life is just a never-ending war that can be won at any time. To overcome one's grief, it is necessary to find happiness in one's life.</p>
